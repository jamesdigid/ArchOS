# ArchOS

The experience of a Desktop, in the form factor of your cellphone. ArchOS is a pet project I dreamed up as a full time developer not wanting to travel with so many laptops, display monitors, and external hard drives. I looked everywhere for such a solution to no avail. I'm hoping through the open source community, others will share the same interest making this a reality.


# Swift
Initial builds for this will be in Swift 4.0 geared to the latest iOS devices with the intention of switching to a more platform agnostic language in the future(Rust?).
