# ArchOS

The experience of a Desktop, in the form factor of your cellphone. ArchOS is a pet project I dreamed up as a full time developer not wanting to travel with so many laptops, display monitors, and external hard drives. I looked everywhere for such a solution to no avail. I'm hoping through the open source community, others will share the same interest making this a reality.


# Swift
Initial builds for this will be in Swift 4.0 geared to the latest iOS devices with the intention of switching to a more platform agnostic language in the future(Rust?). Screenshot of a similar project for Android:

# Features

- Standalone Mode, The ability to edit saved content offline, and perform basic desktop operations.
- Pair Peripherals, Bluetooth your keyboard, mouse, or touchpad directly to your phone and get full desktop experience.
- Remote Desktop Protocol, RDP to any of your desktop by simply connecting and gazing over bring it into focus.
- ArchConnect, Be able to connect snapshots of all your desktops and edit text files from any and all computers.
- ArchVisor, Create a virtual desktop on your phone! which will display commonly used apps, and programs.
- Customize Your Experience, Select how you want your virtual desktops displayed, 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, rotate backdrops of the  sunsetting as it gets late, with a full moon background for late nights.


# DeveloperWood - Release

First release will be built on top of "Developer-Oriented-Design" needs, and generally open source. I dont intend to push the latest code up to GitHub until I reach a certain amount of contributors to help move it forward. Projects such as these seem to stagnate to a halt unless contributors are involved and share the vision. If that's you, then let me know. 


# Contribute

If you have ideas for this project, and can already see its potential then lets divide and conquerer. I have several future release ideas, even playing with RustOS, and emulating a Micro-Kernel to take care of some of the multi-window pane heavy lifting. This is my first open source project, so feel free to give me your suggestions.
