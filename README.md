# ArchOS

ArchOS is built around the principle of "Developer-Oriented-Design" meaning to cater towards the needs of development. This will be built as a mobile application capable of running on any mobile platform, which will allow the ability to pair via bluetooth, create multiple RDP connections (MacOSX, Windows), and create a virtual ArchOS snapshot for offline content authoring, and editing.
