# ArchOS

The experience of a Desktop, in the form factor of your cellphone. ArchOS is a pet project I dreamed up as a full time developer not wanting to travel with so many laptops, display monitors, and external hard drives. I looked everywhere for such a solution to no avail. I'm hoping through the open source community, some progress can be made in developing some of the core foundations off the ground. 

Initial builds for this will be for iOS based devices with the intentions of making it platform agnostic in the future. Screenshots of a similar project for Android:

# QuickWin Goals 

My initial goals are for short quick wins, to build momentum, and run with it. This means, for myself building out a simple stackable, fluid VR window pane enviorment, gaze focusing, live streaming of desktop, and perhaps some search functionality of media. Those stepping stones will help me further work within my own enviorment (maybe you too), and make it more interesting to write in more features. 


# Contribute

If you have ideas for this project, and can already see its potential then lets divide and conquerer. I have several future release ideas, even playing with RustOS, and emulating a Micro-Kernel to take care of some of the multi-window pane heavy lifting. This is my first open source project, so feel free to give me your suggestions.
